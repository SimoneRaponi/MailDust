# MailDust

MailDust is an open-source, innovative solution to password recovery that is, by design, resistant to mail-service provider attacks.
As shown in the comparison table below, MailDust does not impact negatively on the usability and, therefore, on the user experience.

### Server

Given the modularity of the code and the possibility to easily integrate it in each Website, we decided to implement the Maildust server module inside a Docker container. 
Containers technology, providing near bare-metal performance with respect to virtualization, is becoming a standard approach to distribute applications, allowing to run multiple versions of applications on the same machines.
The Maildust Webserver has been implemented over Flask microframework, while for applying Shamirâ€™s secret sharing scheme we relied on the open-source code https://github.com/blockstack/secret-sharing.
In the following, a graphical representation of the MailDust module is depicted, with a zoom in the password recovery process.

#### Requirements for installing the server
 - Docker

### Client

The client module has been implemented in Python 3.6 language, adopting libraries useful to manage the reading of received e-mails, such as imaplib3 and email.
